      <p>
        These pages showcase the use of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX</a> with <a href="https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI">EasyUI</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to combine these two technologies (or solutions, approaches, whatever you want to call them) in practice, as the example on the right shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also turned out not to be very difficult to implement this combination. JSX transpiles into a call to <code class="inline">React.createClass(...)</code>
        and so all that needed to be done was to <a href="https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI-JSX/blob/master/es6/react.js">implement that</a>,
        and then to <a href="https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI/blob/master/es6/mixin/jsx.js">augment</a> EasyUI's base <code class="inline">Element</code> class so that it handled JSX attributes.
        Plus a couple of other minor changes that will surface later and so are not worth mentioning here.
        There's no need to take an interest in any of this but it should be reassuring to know that it wasn't exactly rocket science.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as a showcase, these pages are meant to act as a gentle walkthrough to using JSX with EasyUI.
        It is always difficult to know where to start and there are no instructions here to help particularly.
        It is assumed that you can get the example on the right working with Node.js, Browserify, etc.
        If you are stuck, there are instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI-JSX">readme</a> file in the root of this project.
        You could do worse than to clone the project and run these example pages yourself, in fact.
