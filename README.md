# EasyUI-JSX

JSX support for [EasyUI](https://github.com/djalbat/EasyUI).

EasyUI-JSX allows you to leverage [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) in order to create EasyUI elements rather than React or [Reaction](https://github.com/djalbat/Reaction) ones. All the EasyUI projects listed below support JSX, and its use with them is highly recommended. Not only does using JSX result in less typing and better organisation, it permits elements to created dynamically without resorting to factory methods or cloning.
